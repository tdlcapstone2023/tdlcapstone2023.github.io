# Scope, Research, Requirements
## Scope
The project aims to create a graph database and visualization prototype that integrates data from various sources to provide insights into the relationships between different NFT collections and transactions. The project will focus on NFT collections in the Beauty and Fashion Web3 Space, including the following projects: 
-	Prada-TimeCapsule,
-	Gucci-Superplastic, 
-	Dolce&Gabbana-Collezione Genesi, 
-	ChitoxGivenchy-NFT, 
-	Estee Lauder-Wearable, 
-	ShillaXDr.Jart-Name the NFTs contest, 
-	MAC-VivaGlam, and 
-	DAZ 3D-Non-fungible people
The project will also explore relationships between NFTs and their attributes. The data will be collected from multiple sources, including APIs. The primary objective of the project is to create a visual representation of the data that is easy to understand and provides insights into the relationships between different data points.

## Research
Our team conducts market research on NFTs and NFT collections to gain a better understanding of the market trends and the characteristics of the Beauty and Fashion Web3 Space. Our team explores the various blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum and Polygon, to identify the best platform for data collection. Our team also researches the available tools and technologies to identify the most suitable database for this project. After researching and analyzing the data, our team selects Neo4j graph database and MongoDB as the technologies for prototyping.

## Requirements
Our team uses Jira to track the project progress, including project scope, timelines, milestones, and deliverables. Our team breaks down the project into manageable tasks and prioritize them based on the criticality of the task and its dependencies.

Moreover, our team selects a suitable data scope for the prototype, which includes NFT collections, their attributes, and transactions on Ethereum and Polygon blockchains, primarily using data from the Opensea NFT platform. Our team also identifies the key stakeholders who will be involved in the project, including users, customers, and developers, and collaborate with them to ensure that the prototype meets their needs.
